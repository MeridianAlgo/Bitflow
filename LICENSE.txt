## Additional Terms & Conditions

- **Informational Use Only**: BitFlow v3.0 provides tooling for research, paper trading, and educational experimentation with digital asset strategies using ML-optimized moving average analysis. All outputs are informational only and do not constitute individualized investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice.
- **No Investment Advice**: Quantum Meridian, MeridianAlgo, and contributors are not registered investment advisers or broker-dealers. Users bear sole responsibility for obtaining professional guidance before acting on any information generated by the software.
- **Risk Acknowledgment**: Trading cryptocurrencies or other financial instruments carries a high risk of loss, including the possible loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Use the software entirely at your own risk.
- **Model & Data Accuracy**: The machine learning models, moving average optimization algorithms, and analytics in BitFlow are probabilistic and may produce inaccurate or incomplete outputs. Market conditions, latency, connectivity, and data-provider constraints can impact accuracy and timeliness. The bot tests 208 MA combinations but past performance does not guarantee future results.
- **Data Sources & API Terms**: BitFlow v3.0 integrates third-party APIs (primarily Alpaca for market data and order execution). Access to these services is governed by each provider's terms. Users must obtain valid credentials and comply with each policy. The bot uses Alpaca's quote data (bid/ask) for real-time pricing.
- **Third-Party Models & Dependencies**: The software orchestrates open-source libraries and Hugging Face models via Node.js and optional Python bindings. Each dependency remains subject to its own license; users must review and honor upstream terms.
- **Privacy & Security**: BitFlow processes data locally by default, but users are responsible for safeguarding credentials, infrastructure, and operational environments.
- **Compliance**: Users must ensure their use of BitFlow complies with all applicable laws, regulations, exchange rules, and internal policies in their jurisdiction.
- **Limitation of Liability**: To the maximum extent permitted by law, Quantum Meridian, MeridianAlgo, and contributors disclaim liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential losses arising from use of the software, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
