### How Fees Are Applied:

#### Buy Order:
- Fee charged on crypto received (e.g., buy BTC/USD → fee in BTC)
- Fee = positionSize * feeRate
- Cost = fee * entryPrice (USD value)

#### Sell Order:
- Fee charged on USD received
- Fee = sellValue * feeRate
- sellValue = positionSize * exitPrice

#### Total Round Trip:
```javascript
totalFees = buyFeeCost + sellFee
```

### Example Calculation:

```javascript
// Position: 0.001 BTC at $100,000
// Tier 1 fees: 0.25% taker

// Buy fees:
buyFee = 0.001 * 0.0025 = 0.0000025 BTC
buyFeeCost = 0.0000025 * 100000 = $0.25

// Sell fees (at TP of $101,000):
sellValue = 0.001 * 101000 = $101
sellFee = 101 * 0.0025 = $0.2525

// Total fees:
totalFees = $0.25 + $0.2525 = $0.5025

// Net profit after fees:
grossProfit = (101000 - 100000) * 0.001 = $1.00
netProfit = $1.00 - $0.5025 = $0.4975
```

### Updated Method Signatures:

#### calculateOptimalTPSL:
```javascript
calculateOptimalTPSL(
    priceData, 
    currentPrice, 
    maType, 
    maLength, 
    positionSize = 0.001,      // NEW: for fee calculation
    volume30Day = 0            // NEW: for tier selection
)
```

#### calculatePositionSize:
```javascript
calculatePositionSize(
    accountInfo, 
    riskPercent, 
    entryPrice, 
    stopLoss, 
    volatility,
    volume30Day = 0            // NEW: for tier selection
)
```

### Return Values Now Include:

#### TP/SL Response:
```javascript
{
    stopLoss: 99.24,
    takeProfit: 101.00,
    stopLossPercent: "0.76",
    takeProfitPercent: "1.00",
    riskRewardRatio: "0.39",
    fees: {
        tpScenario: {

            feePercent: "0.503",
            netProfit: "0.4975"
        },
        slScenario: {
            totalFees: "0.4975",
            feePercent: "0.498",
            netLoss: "1.2575"
        },
        buyFeeRate: "0.25%",
        sellFeeRate: "0.25%"
    }
}
```

#### Position Size Response:
```javascript
{
    size: 0.001,
    riskAmount: 100,
    actualRisk: 100.50,        // Includes fees
    actualRiskPercent: "1.01",
    fees: {
        totalFees: "0.5025",
        feePercent: "0.503",
        buyFeeRate: "0.25%",
        sellFeeRate: "0.25%"
    }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility:

All new parameters are optional with defaults:
- `positionSize = 0.001` (minimum)
- `volume30Day = 0` (Tier 1 fees)

Existing code continues to work without changes!

### Test Results:

```
✓ PASS ML Risk Manager (30 tests)
✓ PASS Order Manager (11 tests)

✓ ALL TESTS PASSED
Total: 41 passed, 0 failed
```

### Key Benefits:

1. **Accurate P&L** - Accounts for real trading costs
2. **Better Risk Management** - True risk includes fees
3. **Optimized TP Levels** - Adjusted to ensure profitability after fees
4. **Volume Incentives** - Lower fees for higher volume traders
5. **Transparent Costs** - Fee breakdown shown in all calculations

### Notes:

- Fees are calculated assuming **taker orders** (market orders) for conservative estimates
- Maker orders (limit orders) have lower fees but aren't guaranteed to fill
- Fees are charged on the **received asset** (crypto for buys, USD for sells)
- Fee posting is end-of-day, query next day for actual fees via Activities API
